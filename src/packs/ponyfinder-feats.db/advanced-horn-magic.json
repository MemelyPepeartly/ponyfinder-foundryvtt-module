These mental hands are no more or less able than a human&rsquo;s hands and can reach no further than they could. If you don&rsquo;t already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can Refocus by quiet meditation. For one focus point, you can use the following spell: @Compendium[ponyfinder-foundryvtt-module.ponyfinder-spells.Horn Surge]{Horn Surge}</p>"
